**Impact:** HIGH | **Frequency:** 13/15 participants

> *"I spend at least 30 minutes just comparing similar products. There are so many options, I never feel confident I'm choosing the best one."*
> — **Sarah K., 32, Marketing Manager**

> *"Amazon shows me 500 results for 'laptop.' How am I supposed to know which one is right for me? I usually just give up and buy the one with the most reviews."*
> — **Michael R., 28, Software Engineer**

**Insight:** Users want curated choices, not exhaustive listings.

---

#### Finding #2: Keyword Search Misses Context
