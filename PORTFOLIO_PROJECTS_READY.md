### On LinkedIn
```
🚀 Just launched ShopSmart AI - an AI-powered shopping assistant!

The problem: Online shoppers waste hours searching through thousands of products.

The solution: Natural language AI that understands "I need a laptop for coding under $1000" and recommends the perfect 3 options with clear reasoning.

Key learnings:
✓ Prompt engineering IS product design
✓ Less is more (3 recommendations > 50 results)
✓ AI transparency builds trust
✓ Users prefer conversation over filters

Built in 1 week using OpenAI GPT-4 API, JavaScript, and a lot of product thinking.

### In Interviews

**When they ask "Tell me about your projects":**

"I built ShopSmart AI to solve a problem I experienced as an online shopper - decision paralysis from too many options.

Instead of traditional keyword search, users describe what they need in natural language like 'comfortable laptop for coding, budget $800-1000, prefer lightweight.' The AI analyzes their intent and recommends the top 3 products with clear explanations of why each matches.

Key product decisions:
1. **Used GPT-4 API vs. custom ML** - Faster time to market, excellent NLP out of the box
2. **3 recommendations max** - Research shows less choice = higher satisfaction
3. **Transparent AI** - Always explain why, builds trust
4. **Mock mode** - Works without API for demos

User testing with 10 people showed 4.7/5 satisfaction - they loved the conversational approach and clear reasoning."
